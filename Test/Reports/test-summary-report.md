# Test Summary Report

## Scope

Backend API, frontend dashboard logic, and primary scan flow.

## Current Status

Initial automated test structure has been created and smoke-verified locally on 2026-04-19.

## Results

| Area | Passed | Failed | Blocked | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| API unit tests | 7 | 0 | 0 | `dotnet test Test/API.UnitTests/API.UnitTests.csproj --no-restore` |
| API integration tests | 2 | 0 | 0 | `dotnet test Test/API.IntegrationTests/API.IntegrationTests.csproj --no-restore` |
| Frontend unit tests | 12 | 0 | 0 | `npm test` in `Test/Frontend.UnitTests` |
| E2E tests | 2 | 0 | 0 | `npm test` in `Test/E2E` |

## Evaluation

The test suite prioritizes deterministic tests by using fakes for third-party services. Live provider checks should be documented separately as exploratory or batch validation.

## Notes

Backend tests are run per test project so the API, unit test, and integration test outputs stay separate and easy to diagnose.
